  In today's NBA big men can occupy a vast array of roles on the offensive side of the ball. There are bigs that rely on movement such as cuts and rolls to provide offense such as Robert Williams and Dwight Powell. There are also bigs who are enabled to have a more diverse playing style because of their range of talents like Nikola Jokic and Al Horford. 
  Grouping these center into clusters of playing styles can be informative on how offenses can be modeled around individual skill set. Take for example the way the Minnesota Timberwolves altered their playing style after the hiring of Chris Finch the lauded architect of the Joic-centric Nuggets offense. While it is likely that a team would only build an offense around one of the elite all around offensive centers, the clustering can also be used to find players whose playing style can benefit a current roster or could be optimized by a current roster. This is reflected in the Atlanta Hawks acquisition of Clint Capela. Based on the NBA's tracking data, over 70%  of Capela's play came off of what I define as movement: transition, cutting and rolling plays. This compliments the ability of Atlanta's young star, Trae Young, to play in a pick and roll scheme as an elite passer.
    When using the nearest comparison tool to find the players with most similar play type profile to Clint Capela, one player that stood out is Isaiah Stewart of the Detroit Pistons. The Pistons have a promising arsenal of playmakers in their previous two lottery picks, Cade Cunningham and Killian Hayes.
