My name is Samuel Radack. I graduated from the University of Wisconsin Madison in 2019 with a bachelors in Economics. I recently graduated from the University of Colorado Boulder with my masters in Applied Math.

My primary interests include sports analytics, specifically basketball and soccer, as well as behavioral economics. I am currently looking for employment.
